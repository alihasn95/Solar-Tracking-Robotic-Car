# Solar-Tracking-Robotic-Car
robotic car capable of automatically  tracking the sunâ€™s movement to harness solar energy for recharging its batteries via  integrated solar cells. The system relies on a combination of four directional light dependent resistors (LDRs), an image-processing camera mounted on a servo motor,  and  ultrasonic sensors at the front and rear
